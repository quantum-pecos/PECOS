/// Base trait for quantum simulators.
///
/// This trait defines the minimal interface that all quantum simulators must implement,
/// whether they track quantum states, observables, or other quantum mechanical properties.
pub trait QuantumSimulator {
    /// Resets the simulator to its initial configuration.
    ///
    /// The exact meaning of reset depends on the simulator type:
    /// - For state vector simulators: resets to |0âŸ© state
    /// - For observable propagators: clears tracked operators
    /// - For stabilizer simulators: resets to trivial stabilizer group
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `&mut Self` - Returns self for method chaining
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```rust
    /// use pecos_qsim::{QuantumSimulator, CliffordGateable, StdSparseStab};
    ///
    /// let mut sim = StdSparseStab::new(2);
    /// sim.x(0)
    ///    .cx(0, 1)
    ///    .reset()  // Return to initial configuration
    ///    .z(1);    // Can continue chaining methods
    /// ```
    fn reset(&mut self) -> &mut Self;
}
